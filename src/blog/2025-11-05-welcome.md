Welcome to the new blog! Posts live inside the repository under `src/blog/` with filenames that begin
with the date, like `2025-11-05-welcome.md`.

Add front matter fields for `title`, `description`, and `date`. The Eleventy build will transform each
Markdown file into a page at `/blog/<slug>/` and list it automatically on the archive page.

```bash
# Example authoring flow
cp src/blog/2025-11-05-welcome.md src/blog/2025-12-01-new-platform-post.md
# edit the file, then
npm run build
```

Once the changes land in the repository (via commit or PR merge), GitHub Pages can rebuild the static
site and surface the new article.
